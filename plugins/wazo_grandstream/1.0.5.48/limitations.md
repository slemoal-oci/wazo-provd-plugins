# Limitations

* **Phonebook**: it is not possible to use the Wazo phonebook using the GRP261x phones, due to a
  lack of features in the XML Application.

* **Function keys**: a function key cannot be set at the same position as a line key. If you have
  a line on position 1, you cannot have a function key at position 1.
