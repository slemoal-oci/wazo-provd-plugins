# Installation

If you have phones using the UNIStim software, they must be in
version 0625C39 or higher. Firmware upgrade from UNIStim to SIP can only
be done via TFTP. That's why this plugin has some support for TFTP.

You might have to set MODE to FORCED in 1220SIP.cfg/1230SIP.cfg if you
want the phone to upgrade its firmware. There seems to be some mysteries
around why the phones don't want to upgrade their firmware sometimes.
